Files Included in Submission lab1-405111152.tar.gz:

lab1a.c:
C source file that is compiled into an executable file "lab1a" when "make" or "make all" is run.
One accepted option: --shell.
One option with required argument: --shell.
In essense, the purpose of lab1a.c is to connect the terminal with a functioning shell, redirecting inputs from both and processing characters in real-time.
Without the --shell option, lab1a re-implements the character-by-character echo functionality.
With the --shell option, lab1a runs an interactive shell.

Makefile:
Supports the following targets:
all . . . builds execuable lab1a out of lab1a.c with -Wall and -Wextra options.
clean . . . removes executable and tar.gz files.
dist . . . builds distribution tarball.

Files Included in Submission lab0-405111152.tar.gz:

lab0.c:
C source file that is compiled into an executable file "lab0" when "make" or "make all"
is run.
Four accepted options: --input --output --segfault --catch.
Two options with required arguments: --input --output.
In essence, purpose of lab0.c is to copy from fd0 and paste to fd1, where --input
or --ouput may be used to redirect fd0 and fd1.
--segfault causes a segmentation fault, and --catch catches and handles the segmentation fault when used alongside the --segfault option.

Makefile:
Supports the following targets:
all . . . builds executable lab0 out of lab0.c with -Wall and -Wextra options
check . . . runs test cases listed by runTests
clean . . . removes executable and tar.gz files
dist . . . builds distribution tarball
